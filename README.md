# Overview 
A collection of design patterns in Java. 
My aim is to implement all of them (with documentation) as a learning resource/ reference point for myself and others.

| ~~Creational~~  | Structural | Behavioral |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ~~Abstract factory~~  | ~~Adapter~~  |  Chain of responsibility  |
| ~~Builder~~  | Bridge  | ~~Command~~  |
| ~~Factory~~  | Composite   | Iterator  |
| ~~Prototype~~  | Decorator  | Mediator  |
| ~~Singleton~~  | ~~Facade~~  | Memento  |
| ~~Object pool~~  | Flyweight | Observer  |
| | Proxy  | State  |
| | | ~~Strategy~~  |
| | | Template method  |
| | | Visitor  |

## Building
To build, just do a Maven build. Also included is findbugs, jacoco, PMD and checkstyle.

## Running 
Each pattern has a class with a main method that runs that pattern - so you can try them individually. No current method for running them all - but could be done!
